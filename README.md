## How it works
- First you have the option of selecting whether you want to bowl or bat.
### Batting
- If you selected to bat, you have to enter a number between 1 to 6 and the computer will also generate a number between 1 and 6, if both the numbers are the same your OUT else you will score the number you entered.
- After your out, the computer will have to score your target, and it is the same principle as above.
### Bowling
- If you select bowling, it is the reverse one for above, the computer will score first and you will have to chase second
